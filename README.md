# CurrentTime

This little library is a simple timer that triggers a callback function at every change of the desired timespan, down to microseconds. The user can choose between microseconds, milliseconds, seconds or minute updates.

This project is NOT OPTIMISED FOR PRODUCTION USAGE. The goal of this project is to just play around with the Assembly language. It is more like a mental game, a solo chess. a little hobbie that I have.
